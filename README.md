A (thoroughly) parallelized **experimental** Rust vector-graphics renderer with both a software (CPU) and hardware (GPU)
back-end having the following goals, in this order:

  1. **Portability**; supporting Fuchsia, Linux, macOS, Windows, Android & iOS.
  2. **Performance**; making use of compute-focused pipeline that is highly parallelized both at the instruction-level and the thread-level.
  3. **Simplicity**; implementing an easy-to-understand 4-stage pipeline.
  4. **Size**; minimizing the number of dependencies and focusing on vector-graphics only.

It relies on Rust's SIMD auto-vectorization/intrinsics and [Rayon] to have good performance on the CPU, while using [WebGPU] ([wgpu]) to take advantage of the GPU.

## Getting started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
forma = { version = "0.1.0", package = "forma-render" }
```

### System dependencies

There are some system dependencies that won't be downloaded automatically by Cargo. To build forma, you will need a C toolchain (such as `alpine-sdk` on Alpine Linux, or `build-essential` on Debian), and to run the demos, you'll additionally need to install [CMake](https://repology.org/project/cmake), [fontconfig](https://repology.org/project/fontconfig) and [freetype](https://repology.org/project/freetype).

## 4-stage Pipeline

## Implementation Highlights ‚ú®

Here are a few implementation highlights that make forma stand out from commonly used vector renderers.

<details>
<summary>Curvature-aware flattening</summary>

All higher cubic B√©ziers are approximated by quadratic ones, then, in parallel, flattened to line segments according to their curvature. This [technique] was developed by Raph Levien.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cheap translations and rotations</summary>

Translations and rotations can be rendered without having to re-flatten the curves, all the while maintaining full quality.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Parallel pixel grid intersection</summary>

Line segments are transformed into pixel segments by intersecting them with the pixel grid. We developed a simple method that performs this computation in *O(1)* and which is run in parallel.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Efficient sorting</summary>

We ported [crumsort] to Rust and parallelized it with Rayon, delivering improved performance over its pdqsort implementation for 64-bit random data. Scattering pixel segments with a sort was inspired from Allan MacKinnon's work on [Spinel].

[Spinel]: https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/graphics/lib/compute/spinel/

</details>

<details>
<summary>Update only the tiles that change (currently CPU-only)</summary>

We implemented a fail-fast per-tile optimizer that tries to skip the painting step entirely. A similar approach could also be tested on the GPU.

You can run the demo above with:

```sh
cargo run --release -p demo -- spaceship
```

## Similar Projects

forma draws heavy inspiration from the following projects:

* [Spinel], with a Vulkan 1.2 back-end
* [vello], with a wgpu back-end

[vello]: https://github.com/linebender/vello

## Example

You can use the included `demo` example to render a few examples, one of which is a non-compliant & incomplete SVG renderer:

```sh
cargo run --release -p demo -- svg assets/svgs/paris-30k.svg
```

It renders enormous SVGs at interactive framerates, even on CPU: ([compare to your web browser])

## (Currently) Missing Pieces üß©

Since this project is work-in-progress, breakage in the API, while not drastic, is expected. The performance on the GPU back-end is also expected to improve especially on mobile where performance is known to be poor and where the CPU back-end is currently advised instead.

Other than that:

* Automated layer ordering
* Strokes
* More color spaces for blends & gradients
* Faster GPU sorter
* Use of `f16` for great mobile GPU performance
